                Hello! My name is Kevin and I am a young french developer. I enjoy creating things on the Internet and always
                want to learn more about new technologies such as artificial intelligence.
                Although itâ€™s not my favorite activity, I am also interested in graphic and UI/UX design.
              </p>
              <p>
                My favorites technologies to build website are JavaScript (TypeScript), Node.js, React, Sass.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside programming, I like practicing daily calisthenics to remain in a good shape,
                read manga and watch anime during my free time.
              </p>
